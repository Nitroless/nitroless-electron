#Nitroless Electron
To test the app just git clone this project and then, make sure you have nodejs installed. Then in a terminal - 

```
cd nitroless-electron
npm i
cd react-app
npm i
cd ../
npm run dev
```

Sometimes the React App tends to load later and the electron app runs quicker, if that happens wait till the terminal says the React JS App is compiled, then open nitroless app from the Windows Notification Area and just `Ctrl + R`
